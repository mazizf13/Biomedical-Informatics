**Modeling Cancer Precision Medicine**

Here we will make use of unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches to extract insights from multi-omics data of breast cancer cell lines in response to various cancer treatments. https://learn.omicslogic.com/courses/course/project-05-modeling-cancer-precision-medicine.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how the data from the publication by Daemen et al. "Modeling precision treatment of breast cancer", Genome Biol. 2013. The researchers tested 90 therapeutic compounds on 70 breast cancer cell lines (out of 84 lines comprising their collection) and determined GI50 â€” concentrations required to inhibit cell growth by 50%. Daemen et al. deposited results of RNA-Seq (GEO: GSE4821) for 56 cell lines, including 52 for which GI50 data was also available. Finally, the authors specified an associated breast cancer subtype for each cell line.
